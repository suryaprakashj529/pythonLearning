# integer division ( 4.5 // 2)  = 2

# exponent ( 9 ** 2)  = 18

# "54" + "65" = "5465" is str 
# 4/5 = 0.8 ( in python "/" always returns float so 0.8)
# 
# important and note point 
# 9//2.5 = 3.0 ( integer division always return only integer but if operand is type float it will return float forcefully)

# This expression uses the integer-division operator (//), which returns the number of times that the denominator evenly divides the numerator.

# Here, 2.5 evenly divides 9 three times. The correct answer is 3.0 as opposed to 3, because the denominator is a float, which means that the result will also be a float.

# 7/1 = 7.0
