# In Python, class attributes are attributes associated with a class, not an instance of a class. 
Class attributes can be accessed by using the class name or from any instance of the class.

###
 Class methods accept a mandatory cls parameter 
and are denoted using the @classmethod decorator, 
while instance attributes accept a mandatory self parameter. 
Class methods don't have access to an instance and therefore, 
can only modify and access class attributes and
 can only call other class (or static) methods.
  Instance attributes have access to an instance and can modify and 
access both instance and
 class attributes as well as call any other methods defined in the class.4
