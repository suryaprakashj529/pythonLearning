# A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.
# A set holds individual elements.

"""
x = set("hello world")

When converting a string to a set, all of the unique characters in the string are added to the set. Therefore, {'h', 'e', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'w', 'r', 'd'} is the correct answer.

x = set()
x.add("hello world")

print(x)

output:
{'hello world'}

set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

x = set1 - set2

{1, 3}
Explanation
The set difference of sets A and B, denoted A â€“ B, is the set of all elements in A that are not in B. In this case, the set difference is {1, 3}.

"""
Which of the following expressions indicates whether set1 is a proper subset of set2?

set1 < set2
Explanation
The < operator indicates whether one set is a proper subset of another. Therefore, set1 < set2 is the correct answer.
"""

"""
Which of the following expressions indicates whether set1 is a superset of set2?

Explanation
The >= operator indicates whether one set is a superset of another. Therefore, set1 >= set2 is the correct answer.

What is the value of x in the code snippet below?

set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
set2 = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
x = set1 ^ set2

Answer
{1, 3, 7}
Explanation
The ^ operator returns the symmetric difference between two sets. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. Therefore, {1, 3, 7} is the correct answer.

set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
set2 = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
x = set1 | set2

Answer
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Explanation
The | operator is the union operator and is used to combine or join two sets together. Therefore, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} is the correct answer.
