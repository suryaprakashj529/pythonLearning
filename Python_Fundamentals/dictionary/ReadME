# A dictionary is a good choice when you care about how many times items occur in a collection or if they exist in it at all. This is because determining if an item exists in a dict is much faster than doing so in a list, and you can map an item to its frequency in a dict.

# A dictionary doesn't maintain the order in which items are added to it, but a list does. A tuple also maintains the order of items but it's items cannot be modified.

# In Python, trying to access a key that doesn't exist in a dictionary raises an exception.

# To avoid this, you should use the .get(key, default=None) method, which will return None if the key doesn't exist in the dictionary that the method is called on.

"""
# Write your code here.

# You'll have to use the string: "Enter a string: "
# prints the characters and their frequencies 

count = {}
while True:
    str = input("Enter a string: ")

        count[char] = count.get(char,0) + 1
