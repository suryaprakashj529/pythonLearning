lst = [3, 4, 2, -1, 2]

In Python, the .sort() method sorts a list in place (it mutates the list),
 and it doesn't return a value. Any Python function or method that doesn't return a value returns None by default; 
therefore, the code will output None.

In Python, the sorted() function takes in an iterable object and 
returns a new list containing the object's elements in sorted order. 
It doesn't sort in place and therefore doesn't mutate the iterable object that's passed to it.

In the provided code, sorted(lst) doesn't change the value of lst; it creates and returns a new list that's sorted. 
Thus, printing lst at the end of the program just outputs the original value of lst, which is [3, 4, 5, 0.1, 2].
